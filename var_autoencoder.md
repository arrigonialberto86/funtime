# Variational autoencoder
## Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): view on deep learning 

### Autoencoders in brief 
An autoencoder consists of two parts, an encoder and a decoder. The encoder will read the input and compress it to a compact representation, and the decoder will read the compact representation and recreate the input from it.
