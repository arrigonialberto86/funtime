# Transfer learning: how to make your convnets great again

Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. 
This phenomenon occurs not only for different datasets, but even with very different training objectives, including supervised image classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), unsupervised density learning (Lee et al., 2009), and unsupervised learning of sparse  representations (Le et al., 2011).
